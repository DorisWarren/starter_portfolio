    <h1>Simplicity, beacuse less is beautiful..</h1>
    <h2>Who am i? </h2>
    <p>Good question. I am on a crazy journey trying to figure that one out. It is a constant flux of change everyday. It has been a fun ride so far. I can tell you my name is Doris Warren. I am 25 years old. One of my favorite memories as a child was riding my bike around. Getting lost in the orange groves. Staring out at the mountains during golden hour. Soaking in peachy sunsets. The moments of peace between my mind and life. It taught me to become still, appreciate my surroundings. I grew up on a ranch in Palm Springs Ca. We grow dates, oranges, tangerines, figs, guavas and mangos. I was born and raised in this hot, sunny land of palm trees. I moved to portland about a year ago. Being here has made me realize i will always be a sun bathing lizzard! Lover of animal, plants,art, and music.</p>
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>School? Not much. I attended two years at College of the Desert. Majoring in Interior Design. I have been working at Premier Physicians Managment Company for the past 7 years. I've had the opportunity to learn a variety of things working for them. Everything from medical assisting, marketing, administrative work, billing, and account managing. Having been so loyal to this comapany I was given the opportunity to work remotly. For the past year I have been able to work from home. Being as this comapny is still in Cailfornia. I have had some time to explore Portland. Working at various lovely coffee shops. Meeting wonderful people. Until I got bord... I realized I wasnt being challenged anymore. So looking for a challenge, trying to find a way to incorporate degin in the modern world. I decided to join Epicodus. It is its own form of design. A tool to build bigger beautiful things. Being able to constantly create visual experiences for people will never get old. There will always be room for growth along with constant change. This is something i am ready for..</p>
